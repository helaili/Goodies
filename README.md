[Render maps](./map.geojson) directly in GitHub. Simply create a file with JSON in and that's it! More on this topic over there :
- [Mapping GeoJSON files on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/) from the original documentation,
- [How to convert Shapefiles to GeoJSON maps for use on GitHub (and why you should)](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/) from Ben Balter to figure out how to create your own geojson files from shapefiles.
- [Ben Balter's repo](https://github.com/benbalter/dc-wifi-social) where my sample above was shameessly stolen from.

[Jupyter notebooks](./jupyter.ipynb) mix text, data and rendering. Create them on [Jupyter.org](https://try.jupyter.org/) and store the result on GitHub.
- [GitHub + Jupyter Notebooks = <3](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3)
- [Jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org/) main site and [Try Jupyter!](https://try.jupyter.org/).

[3D files (stl)](./octocat_head.stl) can be rendered too. This [example](./octocat_head.stl) is one of [Loren Norman's experimentations](http://lorennorman.github.io/octocat-3d/). More information on this with the following pages :
- [3D File Viewer](https://help.github.com/articles/3d-file-viewer/) on GitHub Help.


[Images](./daftpunktocat.gif) can be rendered, but most of all they can be [:sparkles:  diffed](https://github.com/helaili/Goodies/commit/a6e6a3358741bc96cecaae1b011f9651df04e05d). Make sure you play with *Swipe* and *Onion Skin*.

[CSV and TSV](./golf_courses.csv) are rendered nicely too and you can even search within the array!

[PDFs](./enterprise-datasheet.pdf) are beautiful too !

Markdown isn't the only option. [Asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org/) can show up nicely too, check [this sample](./asciidoc.adoc)!
